      "Okay so I felt compelled to jot my thoughts down this Sunday morning. Long term lurker  first time poster. I’m a 30 y/o tech sales guy at a 500 person startup that has picked up and moved from NYC to Miami. I can tell you anecdotally that many of my colleagues as well as multiple friend group continue to talk about DOGE even after the “crash”. Do I honestly believe this gets to $1? No. I do however think we can make it to $.15 easy (which is a 5x return – nothing to sneeze at). Look, the way people will be investing has evolved. I can only describe it as flash mob and social injustice trading. I fully anticipate people will return to DOGE in part to show the older generations that they can invest in whatever they want even if this token’s sole purpose is to micro tip people on reddit – aka defiance in the system that tells them to invest in blue chip wall street stocks that earn 5% annually. In short, I believer the trends will continue and WSB will target this thing will take off as quick as it did on the way up to $.09. Why you may ask? Robinhood. They more or less shut down crypto trading this weekend because DOGE was flying 800+% causing it to crash \n",
      "\n",
      "These are my thoughts. I welcome all feedback but please don’t being up use case, fundamentals technical analysis , etc since that has little relevance in 2021 in crpyto and stocks. This is also not designed to be confirmation bias to anyone holding but I can see how it can be. I recognize that the average person here probably has $100-$500 tied up here so few of us here are actual “whales” that can “move the market”. We can only hope to influence the market by continuing to talk about it here and in other internet forums. \n",

      "\n",
      "Hype is created, either intentionally (by organized groups like here) or unintentionally (by public figures with mass followers) sometimes by both at the same time. Few clever folks seize the opportunity and buy low, price soars. New people, fresh to the trading in general and crypto in particular are getting into the hype and buying, with good intentions, sometimes naive to think that this is different, or that we can make a difference, get control back, outsmart those suits, get rich while showing the finger to Wall st..\n",

      "\n",
      "Doge, a joke coin (no disrespect, it's how it was created), a coin with uncapped supply (like the $) that is mostly popular because of Meme culture, will not go to the moon. It can't. It will inevitably go back, close to it's original price, sooner, rather than later. There's no point in blaming others for selling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why am I feeling sweet and sour, I'm glad that massive audiences are discovering the flaws of the traditional markets. Taking control of their finances and paying attention to the space. No, I don't think that Robinhood is the devil, nor deserve it's backlash. It made trading easy, accessible and brought a huge young audience both to trading stocks and crypto. Their recent decisions deserve criticism, but I think that it was done mostly to protect themselves and their users, rather than pure malice. In the broader picture they did much more good than bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why sour, many of you who bought after 300%,400%, 800% rise will lose. That's exactly how I was in 2017. Fortunately I \"Invested\" (more like gambled) a small sum, an amount which I was willing to loose. I deeply hope that you did too. I hope that you did not risk too much and will not have severe consequences for loosing your investments. For many it's their first dip in this space and losing never feels good. I truly hope that you will not be completely put off and learn from this.\n",

      "1. The crypto market is still in it's early stages, it's still extremely volatile and relatively easily manipulated. High gains can be made as well as high losses. **Don't invest more than you can you can afford to lose!**\n",
      "2. Excitement and hype are great, but be careful of being last to the party. \n",
      "3. Buy for short profits or the long run, not both at the same time. If you are buying something for the long run, understand what it is, believe in it, buy and don't touch it for months or years. If you're buying for short runs, look at the data, study the history, try to learn how to recognize trends. Don't come in when it's 300% up in 8 hours.\n",

      "164 | As someone who rode the legendary $0.30 to $3.80 pump back in December 2017/January 2018 here is my perspective - hope this can help out especially those who are brand new to XRP. \n",
      "\n",
      "This recent run is feeling ridiculously similar to that back then, except condensed from 3-4 weeks into 3-4 days. There is a perfect storm of bullish news/factors: \n",
      "\n",
      "Non-XRP Related factors: \n",
      "\n",
      "~BTC past its previous ATH and consolidating sideways\n",
      "\n",
      "~Alt season has well and truly started\n",
      "\n",
      "~WSB + Doge pumps have every crypto investor salivating for the next big opportunity\n",
      "\n",
      "~A lot of new people are now exposed to crypto from the WSB fiasco which received massive mainstream coverage + Elon tweets \n",
      "\n",
      "XRP related factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "~Ripple's confident response against the SEC\n",
      "\n",
      "~XRP recently recovering from a monumental capitulation (almost all of the weak hands have been shaken out)\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "~An event which supposedly is happening on Monday that may or may not occur\n",
      "\n",
      "~Without the SEC case, XRP would probably be ranging in the $0.70-$1 area at this time (as a conservative estimate) - a simple recovery from the lawsuit (without any external factors) would put us around this range. \n",
      "\n",
      "Back in 17/18 the positive news was BTC reaching all time highs, alt season in full force, Ripple/Garlinghouse in the news, the spotlight being right on Crypto/Ripple, heaps of partnerships and \"household names\" coming on board, a supposed imminent Coinbase listing that may or may not occur.\n",
      "\n",
      "**See the pattern?**\n",
      "\n",
      "I vividly remember buying in at around 33 cents in late 2017 and woke up to XRP at 50 cents. It was the last coin to pump. It was the coin that was dead in the water. Everyone had given up on this sub back then. \n",
      "\n",
      "24 hours ago I bought in at a bit over 30 cents and, what do we have, absolute **Déjà vu** as I see XRP around the 50 cent mark again. What happens next? Well in 17/18 XRP progressively moved from $0.50 --> $1 --> $2 --> $3.80 over a period of around 3-4 weeks. This time, you're looking at a critical timeframe over the next 3-4 days with all time high volume amidst literally the most perfect bull storm that could possible be conjured. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to make any predictions here because crypto is absolutely still an unpredictable beast and whenever I expect something, it either does something opposite or surpasses my expectations by 10x. Just know that if history repeats itself, we are going to be in a *very wild ride* over the next few days. Exciting times indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me give you an idea of what sort of *wild ride* I was referring. Now the way I described it above made it seem like XRP enjoyed a sure and steady rise from $0.30 to $3.80. **This was absolutely not the case**. I remember when XRP made its first move to the $0.50 area, the exchange I was on was very illiquid (and had some terrible trading bots) and the price of XRP skyrocketed all the way up to close to $1 (yes almost double what it was on other exchanges) - later in the day it was back in the 40 cent range. Another day at work which I'll never forget was when every coin was dumping hard as BTC was dropping from its ATH but XRP was the one and only coin in the green as it rapidly climbed towards the $2 mark (passing ETH marketcap along the way) - every single crypto sub was talking about XRP, and I remember people saying yep it's going to overtake BTC marketcap. XRP then proceeded to *crash 50% from its local peak* within hours, only to recover to the same price point half a day later, from where it steamed ahead to brand new ATHs. This happened at least 4-5 times during the entire run. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another important note: the peak volume during the recent pump to $0.70 late last year had about 5x the volume of the XRP pump at its peak in January 2018. I'm anticipating volume over the next few days to be **significantly higher** than this, which means things will get **so volatile, that even the most diamond of hands may not be immune, and the most rational of minds may become irrational**. \n",

      "1. VPN capable of routing your IP address through another country (I use Nord VPN)\n",
      "2. Access to a KYC exchange that you are already well established in (Coinbase, Kraken, etc)\n",
      "3. Access to a non-KYC exchange (Poloniex, Binance\\[non-US\\])\n",
      "4. Funds in said account that can be withdrawn (ie. your funds aren't on hold due to a transfer from the bank)\n",
      "5. A wallet capable of holding XRP (Ledger, Trezor, Atomic (software wallet), etc)\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"How To\"\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Get on your everyday exchange and either convert some other crypto you have to USDC or buy some with FIAT. If you buy it with FIAT, you may not be able to withdraw it right away due to the exchange putting a hold on incoming FIAT deposits.\n",
      "2. Transfer your newly minted USDC to your wallet.\n",
      "3. CLOSE OUT OF YOUR EXCHANGE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD. This is important to do before using a VPN, I have heard stories (especially from Coinbase) where people have been locked out of their account because they accessed it from an IP outside of the US. I don't know if this is true or not, but better safe than sorry, right?!\n",
      "4. Fire up that VPN and connect to some other country (I always connect through Brazil). This is required because non-KYC exchanges are not accessible to US based customers (to my knowledge).\n",
      "5. Navigate to the non-KYC exchange. I use Poloniex, it was a little funky to do so. I received a prompt on the main page once I logged in asking me to put in my State of residence. I selected my state and moved on. It hasn't given me any issues.\n",
      "6. Send a small amount of USDC from your wallet to the exchange, as a test to make sure it goes through.\n",
      "7. Once you verify that the transfer was completed successfully, you can send the rest.\n",
      "8. Use the exchange to convert the USDC you transferred to XRP. You will have to do a limit buy, so pay attention to the current pricing.\n",
      "9. Once your order goes through, you will have XRP on the exchange. Congrats!\n",
      "10. You can either leave it on the exchange or transfer it back into your wallet for safe HODLing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope this helps anyone who is looking buy and HODL XRP living in the US. You could just use Robinhood I suppose, but you don't actually own the currency and screw Robinhood for their shady business practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: If you use both your mobile device and a PC, you can directly transfer from your KYC exchange to the non KYC exchange. Just use the VPN on one or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "If anyone has any questions or suggestions, post them below. I'll do my best to help out!\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1)  Supply means accessibility.  Dogecoin won't hit $32k like BTC, and that's a good thing.  New investors will always be able to get in, meaning it's viability as an ecurrency will always be relevant.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2)  Limitless supply does not mean inflation or deflation.  The addition of Doge does not devalue your Doge.  Just like banks that print money, it only is detrimental when they print at a rate that causes hyperinflation.  The main idea is that Doge has to be issued at a rate that is in the inflationary Goldilocks zone.\n",

      "3)  I'm an idiot, just like everyone else here, so please don't listen to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "4)  Scarcity only matters when something is high value.  Dogecoin isn't high value, and doesn't have scarcity, but that doesn't meant it doesn't have value.  Keep in mind that this is still an ecurrency that can be easily and anonymously transferred between wallets.\n",

      "311 | Long post.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "This is just one random opinion, not financial advice, everybody who tells for sure what is gonna happen in 1 week in crypto is lying to you, do your own research. BUT, here are some ideas that are based on previous cycles that might work, thinking about the next bull run.\n",
      "\n",
      "MAYBE we have already peaked at 42k in BTC. MAYBE we are going to 300, 400, 500k still this cycle. I have no idea because really nobody has any idea of when the cycle tops, that is why we must operate with stop losses an manage our risks, but we do know roughly about when the next cycle beings: BTC halving.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the bear market does come, we will most likely see BTC retrace 60% to even 85% and hear all about those doom stories of how BTC failed and crypto is dead, but that has been 100% normal so far. And as always, if you believe in crypto, you believe that BTC will start rising again by it’s next halving, which is exactly: February 26, 2024. The next cycle beings in 3 years and 1 month. Save this date.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "As it is most common, around a few weeks after or before the halving would be a good entry point for crypto in general. Same as nobody can call the top, nobody can call the precise bottom, but anywhere close to the halving date has always been a good entry point. That happens because the top is too unpredictable, and as I said, though it can be 500k, it also might have happened right now, but we have a way better understanding of where the bull cycle restarts again because it always have been close to the halving so far.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "When the halving do comes, what generally happens? Generally, we get a very strong BTC and top 10 coins run.   \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "BTC and all other solid coins do a 10x and even more after halving. BTC went from 3800 bottom to 42k top so far, and ETH did an even bigger run from 100 bucks to 1470 as of now. Near the halving, having any of the top 10 crypto has always been a really good idea, but BTC and ETH are absolutely must haves, since they are the biggest ones and, even if they get outperformed by some alts, their risk reward is amazing because they are very likely to increase tenfold or more from halving to 8 months - 1 year later and have smallest chance of failing.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "By late 2024 or early 2025, we might get a situation similar to what is happening now: BTC and even ETH are a bit stagnant and we have many many alts popping out of nowhere; BTC is clearly getting outperformed by a lot of them, we also see BTC dominance fall down on the charts. That’s what we call an altseason.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "For the altseason we do expect to BTC to still increase a little, but we also we expect ETH to increase even more and expect other alts to go parabolic. And for this season, we have two strategies that might work for your coin picking:  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Analyze coins from 2017, see how they did in 2020-2021 and base yourself in these finding to hold some coins for 2024. ADA, for example, got a 1.16 ATH at 2017 as has failed to break it so far.  Let’s suppose ADA goes to 2$, 3$ and goes back again to 15 cents for the next run. In that case, ADA would be an excellent choice to hold, since it showed both in 2017 and 2021 that it has great potential to break ATH. But let’s say ADA peaked ATH 1.16 at 2017 and fails to go even over 0.40 in 2021. In this case, maybe ADA is not such a good choice for 2024, since it shows it doesn’t have a pattern of increasing much and then we have many other coins to choose. It’s all gonna depend of how the 2027 demonstrate strength now, because if they don’t pop in 2021, they will most likely now do so again in 2024 too, but if they do, I would pick them.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "\\- Analyze who are the new kids on the block, pick the top 5 ones and do expect massive gains. The best ICOs from 2017 did very very well in that run. The best DeFi coins also have done amazing from december until now. For the 2024, if we have a new cool concept like, I don’t know, Stock Broker Coins (coins with the intent of decentralization and taking the stock market off of the legacy market’s hands and making possible for us to trade stocks in an even better form than Bloomberg, but in the blockchain).  \n",
      " SBC, in this case, would do very well, as I expect any other new 2024 concept to do very well too.  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "My personal strategy is going to be like this:  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever this bullrun shows clear signs that it ended, I’m cashing out for stable coins and I’ll quietly wait for the next run to start in early 2024. By then I’ll hold 60% BTC and 40% ETH for the first months then hold 50% ETH,  30% 2017 and 2021 gems and 20% new concept coins (as DeFi is new now).  \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "As I said, even a week is a very long time for crypto and by 2024 this post might be completely outdated, but beware: do your own research and pick your own coins, just don’t miss out on the next run because crypto is gonna take over the world, we are not going anywhere and even if the bears come at us hard, we are always back by halving’s time.\n",

Gox and forced it to bankruptcy, making the average investors lost millions. Youtube MT. GOX for the whole story. Xrp is also a security and being sued by the SEC and most exchanges delisted them already. If you buy now, you could lose every penny when the SEC shut it down. Xrp is created out of thin air, not mined like bitcoin or dogecoin and the criminal owners held trillions in which they can cash out at any time, pocketing billions. They paid many banks in Japan and others to use their XRP in order to pump up their prices but got caught by the SEC. We would be nervous to have such criminal holding so much power in the world. We don't need another George soros or Rothschild in this world causing more misery. There are a lot of fake pumper for xrp with new accounts with new first time posts, so beware and be safe.

      "I've been in the crypto game since 2017. I've seen all the highs and lows and learnt a few lessons along the way (some the hard way).\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been following all this hype over the last few days with pump and dumps and wanted to share these.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Never invest more than you are happy to lose. This is the most important lesson. If you are using Crypto as a quick get rich scheme, then you are more than likely to end up in the red.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Don't chase the pump, if there is a pump happening and you weren't invested in that coin before the pump, then don't buy it. The likelihood is you have already missed the peek and will ultimately lose money. I have done this many times.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Don't belive everything you see on social media, over 50% of the accounts are fake, its easy to photoshop a fake buy. Most accounts trying to push pumps are other newbies trying to reduces their losses cause they brought at the peek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best thing for buying crypto in my experience is research coins, and buy them for a medium too long term investment. I have lost hundreds trying to make a quick profit, but made lots more holding good coins that i have researched.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of all, enjoy it and have fun. You never know you might make a bit of extra money along the way.\n",

      "570 | [$DOGE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&src=cashtag_click) is the most pure coin on the planet because the creators originally intended for it to be a \"joke\". Though, they did make it a perfectly legitimate cryptocurrency using the same algorithm as LTC wth modified specs for faster transaction speed. Best for daily purchases.  What better coin to go mainstream as a spending coin than one that was not made to financially benefit the creator or group of insiders with a premine or late public release. [$DOGE](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&src=cashtag_click) is the most pure coin. No Big Financial Players/Hedge Funds/ Governments had a chance to get in before it went big public, or atleast didnt think they needed to go in. This is the win the people want. Now we get to be the first ones in before the big money has no choice but to join. All hail the 7th dimension of DOGE financial freedom! The Main argument of $DOGE not being able to have value is \"BTC market cap is XX trillion which would make the DOGE market cap XXXXXXXXX trillion, thats impossible!\". This is a common Bitcoin maximalist idea. Why cant the worlds most used spending coin and possible international borederless currency not have more market cap than Bitcoin? Or, maybe Bitcoin should be worth 5-10x more than it is now?! Bitcoin is too slow to use for a spending coin, it is more like virtual gold than anything, this comparison needs to stop.\n",

      "674 | Cryptocurrency is very popular and growing every year. Older generations might not understand unless they're very tech savvy. Eventually they will understand, or the newer generations will continue to grow and adopt it. I'm pretty sure the US Government is thinking of a way to go all digital but they hate the decentralized anonymous secure wallets aspect. (would put a lot of big banks out of business unless they figure out a way to make USD digital only in the future) The world is moving towards crypto whether we like it or not. These volatile times we live in are gonna be a MYTH 50 years from now. Blockchain (LINK) is brilliant and is the future. BTC is a gold rush joke that will most likely go until it's a $1,000,000 USD a coin in 2055, Dogecoin will in fact hit $1, $5 and beyond in the future, It's common sense, meme or not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Point is, if you like the idea of a decentralized anonymous digital currency STOP checking the price of your coins in USD and just worry about how much COINS you have. You're not gonna sell in TWO weeks or even TWO years and get rich in USD....Collect and HOLD. We don't even want USD. WE WANT CRYPTO. Hopefully 10 Years from now our \"DogeCoin, XRP, LINK, and others\" are at a spot where we generated so much collateral we can be \"Millionaires\" for being early adopters by trading our coins into the new world wide accepted crypto of the future. \n",
      "\n",
      "tldr: If you are fortunate enough to throw $100 into a crypto currency and forget about it. DO IT. Collect coins. Buy $100 of Doge. Buy $100 of LINK. Buy $100 XRP. Stop checking the USD value. COLLECT. HOLD. This is the future and this is just the beginning.\n",

      "833 | I am not one to make posts like this, as I usually prefer to lurk. But given the massive spikes in #DOGE price I felt compelled to share my thoughts on the matter. As my name implies, I hold a significant amount of it, so take what I say with a grain of salt. And this is NOT Financial Advice. \n",
      "\n",
      "First a couple of facts I want to list that are important, but please verify all I say. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Doge has a circulating supply of 128 Billion Doge. \n",
      "* Doge inflation is fixed at 5 Billion new Doge per year.\n",
      "* Doge's current price point is useful for daily transactions (easy to calculate day to day costs in it). \n",
      "* Doge value, like early Bitcoin, was derived from the faith (in it) of it's adopters.\n",
      "\n",
      "A number of people are scared of the fact that Doge in inflationary in nature, but this is actually a good thing. When you take into account that hardware wallets are sometimes damaged, lost, or stolen, and that this is an ongoing process, then the inflation isn't such a bad thing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, when you have a fixed amount like Bitcoin, you have a case where the early adopters are going to see the most gains. And this leads to hoarding in the expectation of price increases. Sounds like a good thing right? But not really. For you see, above all else, a thing has to be useful.\n",
      "\n",
      " Once upon a time, people used shells as a form of currency. Much later, precious metals became the more useful thing. People didn't go from shells to gold directly, but my point is that something more liquid and useful replaced shells. And that something was eventually replaced by silver and gold. Then gold was replaced by fiat, and now fiat is losing to crypto. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bitcoin is now like the shells. It's this big, unwieldy thing that's hoarded by early adopters and institutionals. When your unit of measure is $30,000 per unit, it's clearly a sign that it's not fit for daily use. I know what you are thinking, Bitcoin can be subdivided as much as you like, but try working out what $5 is in Bitcoin. It's much easier to say that it's around 185 Doge. \n",
      "\n",
      " Bitcoin has it's origins in Cypherpunk movement. It was meant to free us from government and corporate oppression. It's early adopters were the techies and fringe elements of society. Then for a while it was cool, seen as the domain of geeks and hackers. But just like planking, it's cool until your dad is doing it. The early adopters who hodled are now millionaires, and the corporate overlords have swarmed in as well. It's original purpose of freeing the little guy has been bastardized in favor of enriching the 1%.\n",
      "\n",
      "So a revolt is inevitable. This generation of outcasts, broke college students, and struggling working class will see through the sham that Bitcoin is becoming and reject it. But for what? The collective disgust with the current financial system, Bitcoin included, will be the thing that will make Doge the true successor to early Bitcoin. For it is the most fringe coin in existence. And for a time it will be a way to escape the clutches of corporate greed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I foresee the fringe joke aspect of doge fading. In time, people will treat Doge as any other means of payment, and it will be what Bitcoin is becoming today. It will be co-opted and bastardized by corporations and millionaires. Then the outcasts and techies will have moved on to some new thing that's not even been invented yet. \n",

      "859 | So there has been a lot of negativity from sellers and lurkers. After the sell offs I was sad to see that so many people got scared off. I've been thinking about more than just a $1, $10, $100 Doge. I've been thinking about the Economic evolution of humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here is some analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "Fiat Currency & Crypto currency are the same in concept, however, they are technically different (in terms of minting, mining, application, large scale use, inflate rate). At the end of the day they are both currency. A means of exchange. Not a security, not a stock, not a company, but a measurement of value. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lets have a look at Dogecoin. There are currently 127 Billion Doge circulating. At its peak this week. The market capitalization reached $9Bn dollars. Each time a new block is mined the reward is 10000 Doge. It will inflate infinitely. It is currently deflating (gaining value against the dollar) much faster than it is inflating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparatively:  There were $3.964 trillion circulating by November 2019 (seasonally adjusted). Of that, $1.705 trillion was currency and the rest of the amount was deposits. If you’re looking at money which isn't hard cash the number is about $90.4 trillion. The total market capitalization of the USA is 30,436,313 million. That writes out to $30,436,313,000,000 USD per year. The Dollar will inflate infinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now lets take in to account a rhetorical example: \n",
      "\n",
      "What if you created Dogecoin in 1862? It was a literal coin and also had paper currency which was used absolutely everywhere. It has an assigned value that inflated and deflated as time passed and there was need or want for it. On top of that every year thousands, tens of thousands, millions of new Doge were minted and printed. It conducted all transactions no matter the where, how, or why. Its use then grew for 160 years. Congrats, thats the Dollar we know today. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finance bros, Suits, Economists they're all asking \"But what really IS a cryptocurrency? Is it like a stock? Why does it have value?\" They don't even realize that would be like asking \"What's a dollar bill?\" In my opinion, Doge is extraoordinarily the closes cryptocurrency has gotten to wanting to be like Fiat. It's popular, people want to own it, they especially want to use it, everyone looking to the future knows it can be something magnificent. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"But what about the structure??\" You might ask. Well here's the Deal. In the US the FED mints new bills every year by the trillions. Every nation in the world has a Central Bank that mints their currency. Doge doesn't have a government it has something infinitely better: Developers and the Internet. Doge doesn't have a Central Bank printing new coins. It has thousands of independant miners. \"Wait what? No Government and no central bank just a bunch of randos I don't know setting the scrypt and mining the Doge? How the hell do I know they're not gonna just hoard it all for themselves?\" The answer to that question is a word that everybody hates: Inflation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me create another rhetorical example. (Disconsidering governments, politics, and central banks) What if every person on earth decided to start buying and using the one of the most inflated currencies in the world: The Venezuelan Bolivar which is currently worth 10c USD? The sudden interest for VEF would skyrocket and it's value would deflate immensely in relation to the Dollar. It would spike constantly, crash constantly, each time peaking higher and crashing lower as more individuals kept buying on to VEF and giving value to it. Eventually it would match with the dollar as it gets exchanged. Fast forward five to ten decades from the point they were matched, a globally linked economy using VEF would have a value unimaginably higher than before. Every person, with an ever exploding population on earth would be using it. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is what Dogecoin could be. Dogecoin isn't a pump and dump because there's no colluding main interest group to gain from it. It's not a pyramid scheme because there's no one at the top waiting to steal you money. When it spikes, many new people buy, many hold, some sell. It crashes. Those who most recently joined either continue to hold, buy more, and wait for the next spike. Those who bought at a high keep holding through the dip. It spikes again, EVEN MORE people including those who profited on the last spike buy. It crashes again. Each time there is a spike and a crash. The monetary and functional value that people give to Dogecoin increases. We are essentially speedrunning the life cycle of an emerging market currency.
